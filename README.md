# cppm2pwm
atmel328 light decoder for PPM signal and PWM output of selected channels

It can be used on an arduino board with small footprint (nano or promini) together with a FrSky D4R receiver configured on CPPM output, if you want to decode the CPPM signal in parallel with the flight controller. You would want to do this if you need to use one of the channels to control another device using the selected channel as PWM signal.

Please note that this is still a draft that works perfectly for my needs but might need some adaptation for your needs. Please feel free to contribute.

Thanks
